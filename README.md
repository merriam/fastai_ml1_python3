FASTAI for Python 3.
====================

This attempts to update the excellent FastAI course "Deep Learning For Coders (Part 1)".   Specifically:
* This updates the Python to 3.6 and other libraries to later versions as well.  There should be only minor syntax migrations.  It's more of a preference:  which language do you choose.
* The repository contains all the data and other files that were also available from files.fast.ai.  The idea is to make getting thought the first lesson as trivial as possible.

There is almost nothing in this repository that is my own work.  All the work was done by FastAI or the roebius3 repository.  I am not affliated with either.
